# seapunk
a very basic c shell -

seapunk is intended to be a quick review of basic C99 in time for going deeper into unix and systems programming in an upcoming course
regarding operating systems. the framework of seapunk is based upon a combination of stephan brennan's C shell tutorial and some 
coursework notes from a second year session of CSC209.

seapunk has four current builtins:
  - swimto (cd)
  - splash (ls)
  - help
  - exit
  
 and currently purely delimits through whitespace, and has no support for piping or globbing. this will likely be a future goal
 for this project, if it is to be fleshed out fully as a potential shell.
